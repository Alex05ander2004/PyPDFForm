# 2025-05-24: V3 Announcements

This article contains import information about the upcoming version 3.0.0 release.

## TL;DR

PyPDFForm version 3.0.0 is tentatively scheduled to be released on June 24, 2025.
This major release will contain changes that are backward incompatible.
If you do not wish to trigger any downstream regression, pin your version to 2.5.0 or lower ASAP.

Below is a list of said changes:

* `FormWrapper` is removed. All of its functionalities are migrated to `PdfWrapper`. From now on the `fill` method of `PdfWrapper` will behave just like it did in `FormWrapper`.
* Filling while enabling `adobe_mode` has changed. Now instead of passing `adobe_mode` as a keyword argument to the `fill` method, you pass `adobe_mode` as a keyword argument when instantiating a `PdfWrapper` object.
* Setting font properties globally (e.g., `PdfWrapper("sample_template.pdf", global_font_size=20)`) is not supported anymore. Font properties will now be set through each widget.
* `register_font` is now a object level method instead of a class method.
* `PdfWrapper.preview` is removed.
* Changing `button_style` for existed checkboxes or radio buttons is not supported anymore. (Specifying `button_style` when creating them is still supported)
* Render widgets flag `render_widgets` is removed.
